Project Overview: The Airbnb Clone project aims to create a robust and scalable backend foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. The project goals include implementing user management, property management, booking system, payment processing, review system, and data optimization.

Project Goals:

User Management: Secure user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Create, update, and retrieve property listings.
Booking System: Reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.
Tech Stack:

Backend Framework: Django
RESTful API: Django REST Framework
Database: PostgreSQL
Query Language: GraphQL
Asynchronous Task Handling: Celery

Responsible for database performance tuning, backup, and recovery.
DevOps Engineer:
Handles the deployment, monitoring, and scaling of backend services.
Ensures the smooth operation of the production environment.
Responsible for setting up and maintaining CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), and caching (Redis).
QA Engineer:
Ensures that the backend functionalities meet quality standards and are thoroughly tested.
Develops and executes test cases, identifying and reporting defects.
Collaborates with the development team to resolve issues and improve the overall quality of the project.


Technology Stack:
Django:
Purpose: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Description: Django provides a comprehensive framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications, including tools for routing, templating, and database interactions.
Django REST Framework:
Purpose: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
Description: Django REST Framework is a library that builds on top of Django to provide a simple and consistent way to build RESTful APIs, including features such as serialization, authentication, and caching.
PostgreSQL:
Purpose: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
Description: PostgreSQL is a robust and scalable database management system that provides a reliable way to store and manage data, including support for advanced features such as indexing, caching, and concurrency control.
GraphQL:
Purpose: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Description: GraphQL is a query language that provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with the backend, allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need and receive only the requested data in response.
Celery:
Purpose: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Description: Celery is a distributed task queue that allows the project to run tasks asynchronously in the background, improving performance and scalability by offloading time-consuming tasks from the main application.
Redis:
Purpose: Used for caching and session management.
Description: Redis is an in-memory data store that provides a fast and efficient way to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database and improving application performance.
Docker:
Purpose: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
Description: Docker provides a lightweight and portable way to package and deploy applications, ensuring that the project runs consistently across different environments and reducing the risk of compatibility issues.
CI/CD Pipelines:
Purpose: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
Description: CI/CD pipelines provide a automated way to build, test, and deploy code changes, ensuring that the project is thoroughly tested and validated before being released to production.
OpenAPI:
Purpose: Standard for documenting and describing RESTful APIs.
Description: OpenAPI provides a standardized way to document and describe RESTful APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the API.
