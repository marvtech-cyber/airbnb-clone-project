Project Overview: The Airbnb Clone project aims to create a robust and scalable backend foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. The project goals include implementing user management, property management, booking system, payment processing, review system, and data optimization.

Project Goals:

User Management: Secure user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Create, update, and retrieve property listings.
Booking System: Reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.
Tech Stack:

Backend Framework: Django
RESTful API: Django REST Framework
Database: PostgreSQL
Query Language: GraphQL
Asynchronous Task Handling: Celery
Caching and Session Management: Redis
Containerization: Docker
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated testing and deployment pipelines

Technology Stack:
Django:
Purpose: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Description: Django provides a comprehensive framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications, including tools for routing, templating, and database interactions.
Django REST Framework:
Purpose: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
Description: Django REST Framework is a library that builds on top of Django to provide a simple and consistent way to build RESTful APIs, including features such as serialization, authentication, and caching.
PostgreSQL:
Purpose: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
Description: PostgreSQL is a robust and scalable database management system that provides a reliable way to store and manage data, including support for advanced features such as indexing, caching, and concurrency control.
GraphQL:
Purpose: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Description: GraphQL is a query language that provides a flexible and efficient way to interact with the backend, allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need and receive only the requested data in response.
Celery:
Purpose: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Description: Celery is a distributed task queue that allows the project to run tasks asynchronously in the background, improving performance and scalability by offloading time-consuming tasks from the main application.
Redis:
Purpose: Used for caching and session management.
Description: Redis is an in-memory data store that provides a fast and efficient way to cache frequently accessed data, reducing the load on the database and improving application performance.
Docker:
Purpose: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
Description: Docker provides a lightweight and portable way to package and deploy applications, ensuring that the project runs consistently across different environments and reducing the risk of compatibility issues.
CI/CD Pipelines:
Purpose: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
Description: CI/CD pipelines provide a automated way to build, test, and deploy code changes, ensuring that the project is thoroughly tested and validated before being released to production.
OpenAPI:
Purpose: Standard for documenting and describing RESTful APIs.
Description: OpenAPI provides a standardized way to document and describe RESTful APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the API.

Database Design

Users:
Important fields:
id (unique identifier)
username (unique username chosen by the user)
email (user's email address)
password (user's password, hashed for security)
role (user's role, e.g., host, guest, admin)
Description: Users are the core entity of the project, representing individuals who interact with the platform.
Relationships: A user can have multiple properties (as a host), multiple bookings (as a guest), and multiple reviews (as a guest or host).
Properties:
Important fields:
id (unique identifier)
title (property title)
description (property description)
address (property address)
price (property price per night)
Description: Properties represent the accommodations listed on the platform.
Relationships: A property belongs to a user (host), can have multiple bookings, and can have multiple reviews.
Bookings:
Important fields:
id (unique identifier)
property_id (foreign key referencing the property)
user_id (foreign key referencing the user who made the booking)
check_in (check-in date)
check_out (check-out date)
Description: Bookings represent the reservations made by users for properties.
Relationships: A booking belongs to a property, belongs to a user (guest), and can have multiple payments.
Reviews:
Important fields:
id (unique identifier)
property_id (foreign key referencing the property)
user_id (foreign key referencing the user who wrote the review)
rating (review rating, e.g., 1-5 stars)
comment (review comment)
Description: Reviews represent the feedback provided by users about their experiences with properties.
Relationships: A review belongs to a property, belongs to a user (guest or host), and can be associated with a booking.
Payments:
Important fields:
id (unique identifier)
booking_id (foreign key referencing the booking)
amount (payment amount)
method (payment method, e.g., credit card, PayPal)
status (payment status, e.g., pending, completed)
Description: Payments represent the transactions made by users to pay for bookings.
Relationships: A payment belongs to a booking, and a booking can have multiple payments.
Entity Relationships:

A user can have multiple properties (one-to-many).
A property belongs to a user (many-to-one).
A booking belongs to a property (many-to-one) and a user (many-to-one).
A review belongs to a property (many-to-one) and a user (many-to-one).
A payment belongs to a booking (many-to-one).
